<!--
	Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
	By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

			1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

	By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the 
	sum of the even-valued terms.

	var i; var x=1; var y=2; var z=0; var sum =0;
	console.log(x);
	while (y<4000000) {
		if(y%2==0) {
		sum=sum+y;
		}
		z=x;x=y;y=z+x;
		console.log(y);

	console.log(sum);
